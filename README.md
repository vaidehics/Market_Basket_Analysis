Market Basket Analysis for Retailers aims to optimize inventory management and cross-selling strategies by identifying associations between products. Using transaction data from the Online Retail Dataset, the project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques like association rule mining to uncover purchasing patterns. The analysis involves data preprocessing, followed by Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms to extract frequent itemsets and generate association rules. Visualizations, including network diagrams and heatmaps, illustrate product relationships. A recommendation engine suggests products based on customer purchase history, focusing on scalability and real-time insights while considering seasonality and purchasing trends.
